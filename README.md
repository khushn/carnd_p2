## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

Overview
---
In this project, I use a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. We train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, we try out your model on some new images of German traffic signs from the web.

I have included an Ipython notebook that has all the code:
